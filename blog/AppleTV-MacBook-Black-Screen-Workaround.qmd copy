title: Apple TV+ Showing Black Screen on MacBook Pro? Here's a Workaround
---

### Apple TV+ Showing Black Screen on MacBook Pro

![images/AppleTV-MacBook-Black-Screen.png](images/AppleTV-MacBook-Black-Screen.png)

While trying to watch an episode on Apple TV+, you might encounter a black screen where only the audio and subtitles play, but no video. I’ve noticed this on a few Macs, and while I can’t pinpoint the exact cause, I suspect it may have something to do with DRM in combination with some screen recording utilities or accessibility features I’m using. It could also be related to my use of a beta version of macOS. Whatever the case, this issue has persisted across various combinations of MacBooks and macOS versions.

### Workaround: Using a Web Browser

If you're facing this issue, the workaround is surprisingly straightforward: use a web browser instead of the native Apple TV+ app or Safari. While it might seem counterintuitive, this approach has consistently worked.

#### Supported Browsers
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera
- Firefox

*Note: Safari, unfortunately, redirects you back to the native Apple TV+ app, so it's not ideal for this workaround. Apple officially mentions using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or Firefox as alternatives in their [browser guide](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/tvplus/apdc0cb7ad64/web).*

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Install a Supported Browser:
If you don't already have one of the supported browsers installed, download and install one of the following:
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera
- Firefox

#### 2. Open the Browser:
Launch the browser you installed or already have on your Mac.

#### 3. Navigate to Apple TV+:
Go to [Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com) and sign in with your Apple ID.

#### 4. (Optional) Create a "Chrome App" for Apple TV+:
If you prefer a more native app experience, you can create a shortcut that behaves similarly to a standalone app. This step is entirely optional, but it can make accessing Apple TV+ more convenient.

**For Google Chrome:**
  1. Click on the three vertical dots (More) in the top right corner of the browser.
  2. Select **More tools**.
  3. Click on **Create shortcut...**.
  4. Check the box that says **Open as window**.
  5. Click **Create**.

**For Microsoft Edge:**
  1. Click on the three horizontal dots (More) in the top right corner of the browser.
  2. Select **Apps**.
  3. Click on **Install this site as an app**.
  4. Name the app and click **Install**.

**For Opera:**
  1. Click on the Opera menu in the top left corner.
  2. Select **Extensions**.
  3. Click on **Install Chrome Extensions**.
  4. Follow the same steps as for Google Chrome to create a shortcut.

**For Firefox:**
Firefox does not natively support creating standalone apps, but you can use extensions like **WebApp** to achieve similar functionality.

#### 5. Access the "Chrome App":
Once created, the "Chrome App" will show up in Spotlight search and can be launched like any other application on your Mac. This provides a more reliable experience for watching Apple TV+ content.

### Additional Notes
- **Apple's Guide:** For more detailed instructions on watching Apple TV+ in a web browser, refer to [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/tvplus/apdc0cb7ad64/web). Apple specifically mentions using Chrome or Firefox for the best experience.
- **Other Browsers:** Browsers like Brave and Opera may support similar features for creating standalone apps. The steps are generally similar to those for Chrome and Edge.

### Summary
By following these steps, you can create a browser-based app for Apple TV+ that circumvents the issues with the native app on your Mac. This method leverages the capabilities of modern browsers to provide a seamless streaming experience, even when the native solutions fall short.

### Best Practices:
- Ensure your browser is up to date.
- Use a browser that supports creating standalone apps for the best experience.
- Refer to Apple's official guide for additional support and troubleshooting.
